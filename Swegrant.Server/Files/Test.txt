wrong with you?

What is going on?

4
00:00:06,223 --> 00:00:07,964
He's dropping out
of school!
What?!

5
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,270
It's not a big deal.

6
00:00:09,313 --> 00:00:11,533
You are finishing high school,
end of discussion.

7
00:00:11,576 --> 00:00:13,926
It's my life.It's my house.

8
00:00:13,970 --> 00:00:16,103
If you don't go to school,
you can't live here.

9
00:00:16,146 --> 00:00:18,453
Hold on. We are
not kicking him out.

10
00:00:18,496 --> 00:00:19,541
The hell we're not.

11
00:00:19,584 --> 00:00:21,325
I'll pack right now.

12
00:00:21,369 --> 00:00:23,284
Stop. You don't have to go.

13
00:00:23,327 --> 00:00:26,026
Yes, he does.
My house, my rules.

14
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:32,293
I've always had a curious
affinity for Laundromats.

15
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:34,469
Perhaps it's the rows
of mechanical devices

16
00:00:34,512 --> 00:00:36,471
dedicated to a cleaner world.

17
00:00:36,514 --> 00:00:38,603
Or maybe it's
the hypnotic rotation

18
00:00:38,647 --> 00:00:41,389
of spinning clothes
on their sudsy journey

19
00:00:41,432 --> 00:00:44,000

20
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:46,002
Mmm, look at 'em.

21
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,308
Where was I?

22
00:00:47,351 --> 00:00:49,223
Oh, yes. Laundromats.

23
00:00:49,266 --> 00:00:51,225
My meemaw also loved them,

24
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:54,271

different reason.

I don't care for bananas.

did you know the knife goes
on the right because it was

53
00:02:07,475 --> 00:02:09,477
the first utensil, and
most people are right-handed?

What are you doing here?

59
00:02:20,749 --> 00:02:22,533
Just thought I could
have dinner with y'all.

00:02:22,577 --> 00:02:23,665
Of course you can.

No. Stay.
Mary...

00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,585
He can have dinner with us.

Fine.

66
00:02:32,935 --> 00:02:34,415
Sit.

67
00:02:35,372 --> 00:02:37,200
I'll get you a plate.

I don't know.

00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:44,251
Of course you do.

71
00:02:44,294 --> 00:02:45,252
You go back to school?

72
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:46,253
No.

73
00:02:46,296 --> 00:02:47,819
It sounds like
you don't live here.

74
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:50,561
He's our son. We are
not kicking him out.
He wants

75
00:02:50,605 --> 00:02:52,694
to be an adult,
he can pay for his own place.

76
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:54,174
That was my plan.

77
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:56,393
Okay, what if he
pitches in here?

78
00:02:56,437 --> 00:02:57,699
Like what, rent?

79
00:02:57,742 --> 00:02:59,614
Yes. You would
do that, right?

80
00:02:59,657 --> 00:03:01,616
I guess so.

81
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:03,705
Sounds like someone needs
a rental agreement.

82
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:05,750
I'll go get my legal pad.

83
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:10,625
Pay to live here?
We don't even have a pool.

84
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:17,197
So, there's a secret back room
at the Laundromat

85
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,111
where you gamble?

86
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:21,201
Yeah.
And you never told me?

87
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:22,941
Well, this is how secrets work.

88
00:03:22,985 --> 00:03:24,987
Uh-huh. What else
aren't you telling me?

89
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:27,511
Let me explain secrets.

90
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:29,905
Uh, okay, just give me a sense

91
00:03:29,948 --> 00:03:32,124
of how illegal this is.

92
00:03:32,168 --> 00:03:33,778
Who says it's illegal?

93
00:03:33,822 --> 00:03:35,127
Well, why is it a secret?

94
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:36,999
Okay, it's illegal.

95
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:38,870
But these places
have been around for years.

96
00:03:38,914 --> 00:03:41,960
Nobody gets hurt,
the cops don't care.

97
00:03:42,004 --> 00:03:44,659
I-I thought you liked being
retired-- now you want to be

98
00:03:44,702 --> 00:03:45,921
a business owner?

99
00:03:45,964 --> 00:03:48,184
It's not as much as fun
as I make it look.

100
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,794
Listen,

101
00:03:49,838 --> 00:03:52,536
I've been gambling my whole life

102
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,972
and losing
to the house.

103
00:03:54,016 --> 00:03:59,021
This is my chance
to be the house.

104
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:02,546
You go to prison,
I ain't waitin' for you.

105
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:05,288
You really have the energy
to find a new girlfriend?

106
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,812
I'll wait.

107
00:04:09,292 --> 00:04:10,989
Okay, so we've agreed
on monthly rent.

108
00:04:11,033 --> 00:04:13,122
Should we talk utilities?

109
00:04:13,165 --> 00:04:14,732
Why do I got to pay
for that stuff?

110
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:16,821
'Cause you use them
and they cost money.

111
00:04:16,865 --> 00:04:18,606
There are five of us
in the house,

112
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,912
so I suggest he pays 20%.

113
00:04:20,956 --> 00:04:22,784
Although he does take a
long time drying that hair.

114
00:04:22,827 --> 00:04:24,002
20%'s fine.

115
00:04:24,046 --> 00:04:26,004
Hold on.
It takes a whole lot more water

116
00:04:26,048 --> 00:04:27,441
to clean you than me.

117
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:29,791
Hey, watch it. I don't have
to let you live here.

118
00:04:29,834 --> 00:04:31,793
Let me? I'm paying
for everything.

119
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:33,011
You gonna charge me
for food, too?

120
00:04:33,055 --> 00:04:34,448
Mm, it's not the worst idea.

121
00:04:34,491 --> 00:04:37,015
You know what? Maybe I
shouldn't be in this house.

122
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:38,321
You said it, not me.

123
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:40,149
He doesn't have
to pay for food.

124
00:04:40,192 --> 00:04:41,759
Meemaw does eat here for free.

125
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:43,326
That's a separate problem.

126
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:45,894
What if Georgie moves
into the garage?

127
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:47,635
Why?
You'd still
be around,

128
00:04:47,678 --> 00:04:48,897
so Mom's happy,
but you'd be

129
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,333
out of the house,
so Dad's happy.

130
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:54,032
That could work.
What do you say?

131
00:04:54,076 --> 00:04:56,687
Done.
Done.

132
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:58,036
Hold on. All my trains

133
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,342
and science equipment
are in the garage.

134
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:00,778
Where would they go?

135
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:01,953
Easy. I take Georgie's room.

136
00:05:01,997 --> 00:05:03,607
All your crap goes in your room.

137
00:05:03,651 --> 00:05:06,175
That's a big change.
I need to think about this.

142
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,619

Yeah. Oh, yeah.

159
00:05:47,303 --> 00:05:49,392

No. Uh-uh.

168

No, actually,
I'm asking for Connie,

169
00:06:10,413 --> 00:06:12,154
'cause she's kind of interested.

170
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:14,156
Hmm. Those places are harmless.

171
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:15,810
We look the other way.

172
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:16,985
Well, that's good to know.

173
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:20,945
So what other laws
are okay to break?

174
00:06:20,989 --> 00:06:22,991
Not hiding drugs
in your keister.

175

You seem the same to me.

181
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,964
I have a training bra.

182
00:06:40,008 --> 00:06:42,445
When you complete your training,
get back to me.

183
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:44,447
You know you want
privacy, too.

184
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:46,362
I suppose it would be nice

185
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:49,278
to have all my trains
and science equipment in here.

186
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:51,367
Great. It's settled.

187
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,717
It would be like
my Fortress of Solitude.

188
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:54,979
Good for you.

189
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:57,852
Or my Bat Cave.
Shh!

190
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:59,331
Although I don't care for caves.

191
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,724
Or bats.

192
00:07:00,768 --> 00:07:02,204
I suppose
Fortress of Solitude...

193
00:07:02,247 --> 00:07:02,857
I'm gonna choke
you with my bra.
Good night.

194
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,829
Want some help?

195
00:07:18,873 --> 00:07:20,440
You gonna charge me money?

196
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,050
Never mind.

197
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,807
Any chance this could wait
till halftime?

198
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:42,331
I'll be done in a second.

199
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,254
Touchdown!

200
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:57,128
What are you doing?
Moving my stuff.

201
00:07:57,172 --> 00:07:59,522
But we haven't discussed
who gets what yet.

202
00:07:59,566 --> 00:08:02,220
I get my stuff.
You get your stuff. Done.

203
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:03,439
There's community property.

204
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,528
We've lived together
for over ten years.

205
00:08:05,572 --> 00:08:07,878
In some states,
we'd be considered married.

206
00:08:07,922 --> 00:08:10,054
Gross.
I don't make the rules.
I just know them all.

207
00:08:10,098 --> 00:08:12,883
What do I have to do
to get this over with?

208
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,233
We just need to agree
upon who gets which items.

209
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:19,368
Fine. As my farewell gift to
you, let's do your dumb thing.

210
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:21,239
See, when you're mean and nice
at the same time,

211
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:22,371
it's confusing.

212
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:23,807
Too bad, doofus.

213
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:25,287
Better, thank you.

214
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:29,421
Okay, thanks.
I'll see you in a bit.

215
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:32,816
Chet's gonna swing by
and finalize the deal.

216
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,035
Wait, he's coming over here?

217
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:35,384
Yeah. Why?

218
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:37,952
Well, this is
a very shady transaction.

219
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:40,563
I mean, it should be
taking place under a bridge

220
00:08:40,607 --> 00:08:43,087
or in a parking lot somewhere.

221
00:08:43,131 --> 00:08:45,176
I'm handing him
a cashier's check.

222
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,265
He's giving me the keys.

223
00:08:47,309 --> 00:08:49,006
He's gonna know where you live.

224
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:51,574
I'm in the phone book.
I'm not hard to find.

225
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:53,097
Well, what if
he grabs the check

226
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:55,099
and just skedaddles
out of here?

227
00:08:55,143 --> 00:08:56,318
He's our age.

228
00:08:56,361 --> 00:08:58,407
He isn't skedaddling
anywhere.

229
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,017
Ah, whatever you say.

230
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:03,325
Are you disappointed this isn't
more like some old cop show?

231
00:09:03,368 --> 00:09:05,849
I loved Rockford Files.

232
00:09:05,893 --> 00:09:07,895
Well, I tell you what,
when he gets here,

233
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,200
you're my muscle.

234
00:09:09,244 --> 00:09:12,290
If anything goes sideways,
you jump in.

235
00:09:12,334 --> 00:09:15,119
See, now you're talking.

236
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:17,557
I'll stand behind you
and I'll crack my knuckles.

237
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,167
With your arthritis?

238
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,473
It's only bad when it rains.

239
00:09:21,517 --> 00:09:25,956
Next, one Timex brand
alarm clock.

240
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,871
It's yours.

241
00:09:27,915 --> 00:09:30,004
Are you sure? It has a stylish
faux-wood finish.

242
00:09:30,047 --> 00:09:32,484
Fine, I'll take it.
Aw.

243
00:09:32,528 --> 00:09:34,312
So you want it?
Yes.

244
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:36,924
It's yours.
Thank you.

245
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:42,320
Next, one useful yet educational
map of the world trash can.

246
00:09:42,364 --> 00:09:43,626
I know what you're doing.

247
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:45,585
Yes, I'm being thorough
about these things

248
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,195
so we don't fight about them
down the line.

249
00:09:47,238 --> 00:09:48,500
What you're doing is
dragging this out

250
00:09:48,544 --> 00:09:49,937
because you don't
want me to leave.

251
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,026
No, I'm not.
Yes, you are.

252
00:09:52,069 --> 00:09:54,332
Do you know the phrase
"pish posh"?

253
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:56,030
No, and I don't want to.

254
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,553
It's British, and it's used

255
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,511
when someone's opinions
are absurd.

256
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:01,296
And you're forcing me
to use it.

257
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:02,645
Pish posh!

258
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:05,256
Or, more authentically,

259
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:06,344
pish posh!

260
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:07,650
I'm done.

261
00:10:07,694 --> 00:10:09,609
I know what's mine,
and I'm taking it.

262
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:11,611
One day she said the same thing

263
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,177
to her first husband.

264
00:10:13,221 --> 00:10:16,224
I like to think I prepared her
for that moment.

265
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:20,271
So I'm thinking dark red,
like a speakeasy.

266
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:23,057
And maybe a little bar
in the corner.

267
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,406
Well, you're gonna need
a liquor license.

268
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:27,191
Oh, right. 'Cause I don't want
to break the law

269
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:30,020
in my illegal gambling room.

270
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:33,371
Over here is my bedroom area,
for sleeping and whatnot.

271
00:10:33,415 --> 00:10:34,721
That's my gym.

272
00:10:34,764 --> 00:10:38,028
And last but not least,
kitchen and bathroom.

273
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,378
Georgie, do not use
that sink as a bathroom.

274
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,642
Relax. Just number one.

275
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:46,384
There you go.

276
00:10:46,428 --> 00:10:48,386
Okay, these posters go
on that wall.

277
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:49,997
That poster goes
over the bed.

278
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,563
I'm not your moving man.

279
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:54,218
You're right, I'm growing up.

280
00:10:54,262 --> 00:10:57,134
Guess I can't be
Daddy's little girl forever.

281
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,398
Which one goes over the bed?

282
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:01,748
Um, New Kids.

283
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,402
First thing I'm gonna do is
get better chairs.

284
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:07,710
If people are comfy, they'll
stay longer and spend more.

285
00:11:07,754 --> 00:11:10,017
Well, what if it's
someone's lucky chair?

286
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,323
They're gambling in the back
of a Laundromat.

287
00:11:12,367 --> 00:11:15,109
Does that sound lucky to you?

288
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:17,241
I'm thinking I'll put the flag
over that window

289
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,416
for, you know, privacy.

290
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,680
If you want, I could
sew some curtains,

291
00:11:20,723 --> 00:11:22,116
make it look homey.

292
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:24,422
Nice. Girls will
eat that up.

293
00:11:24,466 --> 00:11:25,685
Flag is fine.

294
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:43,137
Well, you been busy.
Yes.

295
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,705
You get this in here
all by yourself?
Yes.

296
00:11:45,748 --> 00:11:48,142
How?
Science.

297
00:11:48,185 --> 00:11:49,709
Well, it looks good.

298
00:11:49,752 --> 00:11:52,146
I know. Now trains will be
the last thing I see

299
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:53,364
before I go to sleep,

300
00:11:53,408 --> 00:11:54,583
and the first thing I see
when I wake up.

301
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:55,715
Great.

302
00:11:55,758 --> 00:11:57,325
If I stir in
the middle of the night,

303
00:11:57,368 --> 00:11:58,369
you know what I'll see?

304
00:11:58,413 --> 00:12:01,068
Trains?
Trains.

305
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:06,638
Well... as long as you're happy.

306
00:12:06,682 --> 00:12:08,510
Oh, I'm happy.

307
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,170
Hey.

308
00:12:17,214 --> 00:12:19,477
You might want to
check in on Sheldon.
Is he okay?

309
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:22,045
Well, he was smiling.

310
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:23,655
Smiling how?

311
00:12:24,569 --> 00:12:26,354
Oh, boy.

312
00:12:33,796 --> 00:12:35,363
Hey. Dinner's ready.

313
00:12:35,406 --> 00:12:37,495
I'll eat later.
I have to finish this.

314
00:12:39,802 --> 00:12:42,892
I made spaghetti with
hot dogs cut up in it.

315
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:45,112
I even made sure
that every piece is

316
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:47,070
the exact same size.

317
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:48,898
Some things are more important
than the width

318
00:12:48,942 --> 00:12:50,030
of a hot dog slice.

319
00:12:50,073 --> 00:12:52,815
And I wish I'd
known that sooner.

320
00:12:52,859 --> 00:12:55,775
So, you okay?

321
00:12:55,818 --> 00:12:57,777
Why wouldn't I be okay?

322
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,736
Well, there's a lot
of change going on.

323
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,216
I know that's not
your favorite.

324
00:13:02,259 --> 00:13:03,783
Where is that
railroad crossing?

325
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,785
Would you like to eat in here?

326
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:07,308
I'll make you a plate.

327
00:13:07,351 --> 00:13:08,526
I have to find that sign.

328
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,224
It should be in this box.
Where is it?

329
00:13:15,446 --> 00:13:17,840
I can't find
my railroad crossing sign.

330
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,581
Hey, how about knocking?

331
00:13:19,624 --> 00:13:21,452
Sorry, I've never had to knock
on that door before.

332
00:13:21,496 --> 00:13:22,714
Well, now you do.

333
00:13:22,758 --> 00:13:24,455
I need
the crossing sign

334
00:13:24,499 --> 00:13:25,761
for my train set.
Have you seen it?

335
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:28,590
No, and I've got company
coming soon.

336
00:13:28,633 --> 00:13:30,853
Perfect. An extra set of
eyes will be helpful.

337
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,289
It's a girl, and you need
to get out of here.

338
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:33,769
I'm not leaving
until I find it.

339
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,902
Is this really
about some dumb sign,

340
00:13:35,945 --> 00:13:38,774
or is about you being scared
to have a room to yourself?

341
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,863
That sign has been
there for as long as

342
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:42,734
I've had that railroad set.

343
00:13:42,778 --> 00:13:44,780
It may seem insignificant
to you, but I need it.

344
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:47,565
Everyone only cares
about themselves.

345
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,219
You're happy because
you got the garage,

346
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,742
Missy's happy because
she has her own room,

347
00:13:50,786 --> 00:13:52,744
but no one cares about
my problems.

348
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:54,746
I'll help you look.

349
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,661
Just forget it.

350
00:13:58,925 --> 00:14:02,189
As I struggled, my meemaw
began to realize

351
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:03,799
the problem with running
a gambling den

352
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,627
in the back of a Laundromat was

353
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,498
it's still connected
to a Laundromat.

354
00:14:07,542 --> 00:14:09,805
I put five pairs
of undies in here,

355
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,459
and now there are four.

356
00:14:11,502 --> 00:14:13,330
Your machine ate my undies.

357
00:14:13,374 --> 00:14:15,332
There's a lost and found box
right over there in the corner.

358
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,464
Just take all you want.

359
00:14:16,507 --> 00:14:18,814
I don't want
a stranger's undies.

360
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:21,817
Then let's find
your precious undies.

361
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,689
Look how many rhinestones
fell off in the dryer.

362
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:28,824
It says right here
"do not tumble dry."

363
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,913
No label's gonna tell me
what to do.

364
00:14:30,957 --> 00:14:33,655
I am not in the mood
for Texas right now.

365
00:14:33,698 --> 00:14:34,830
What do you want from me?

366
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,311
Well, what size is yours?

367
00:14:38,355 --> 00:14:39,530
No!

368
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:56,069
Finally the fun begins.

369
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,030
What's going on?

370
00:15:01,988 --> 00:15:04,686
Are you Connie Tucker?

371
00:15:04,729 --> 00:15:07,297
Well, this sucks.

372
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:19,527
Next stop, Medford.

373
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,964
That won't be necessary.
Keep going.

374
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,532
But, sir, your family's
waiting to board.

375
00:15:24,575 --> 00:15:26,012
I'm aware. Drive on.

376
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:27,578
But, sir...

377
00:15:27,622 --> 00:15:29,537
I don't need them.
I'm fine on my own.

378
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,453
Do not stop this train.

379
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:41,288
Turn it off.
No.

380
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:43,855
I've been listening to it
for an hour; turn it off.

381
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:45,857
It's my room, I can
do what I want.

382
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:48,382
Oh, really? Let's see
how you like it.

383
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:50,862
♪ All for love

384
00:15:50,906 --> 00:15:52,734
♪ I love it when
we're together ♪

385
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:55,606
♪ Girl, I need you forever...

386
00:15:58,044 --> 00:15:59,915
What the hell's going on?!

387
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:01,569
Missy's trying to annoy me.

388
00:16:01,612 --> 00:16:03,875
'Cause he won't turn
his stupid train off.

389
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:06,574
You two are unbelievable.
Everything off.

390
00:16:06,617 --> 00:16:08,445
But he started it.
Now!

391
00:16:08,489 --> 00:16:11,579
♪ Knight in shining armor,
I will be your... ♪

392
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:15,452
I thought y'all looked
the other way.

393
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:18,020
We do, but I'm running
for sheriff,

394
00:16:18,064 --> 00:16:20,457
and this will make
my campaign pop.

395
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,503
But you and Dale are buddies.

396
00:16:22,546 --> 00:16:25,375
That's why
I'm not arresting you.

397
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,638
Hey, get one with me in it.

398
00:16:32,948 --> 00:16:34,776
So you gonna sell the place?

399
00:16:34,819 --> 00:16:36,952
No.

400
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,998
Instead of crime boss,
you're gonna be

401
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,782
a laundry boss.

402
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:42,436
Well, I guess that's
just as cool.

403
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,438
I'm gonna open my game room.

404
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:46,048
How?

405
00:16:46,092 --> 00:16:47,093
I don't know.

406
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:49,356
Move to a new location?

407
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,053
I don't know!

408
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,185
What about the Laundromat?

409
00:16:52,228 --> 00:16:54,187
Keep asking questions,
see what happens.

410
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:57,190
Last one.
What?

411
00:16:57,233 --> 00:17:00,193
How'd you get so pretty?

412
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:04,936
I hate you.

413
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,200
I like you.

414
00:17:11,291 --> 00:17:12,988
There were plenty of reasons

415
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:15,251
to be happy my sister
moved out.

416
00:17:15,295 --> 00:17:19,429
She snored, she teased me.

417
00:17:19,473 --> 00:17:21,692
She left her dirty clothes
everywhere.

418
00:17:24,695 --> 00:17:28,395
Clearly, I was better off
without her.

419
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,491
Can I sleep on your floor?

420
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:39,449
Come on.

421
00:17:49,111 --> 00:17:50,069
I eventually made my peace

422
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:51,722
with having a room to myself.

423
00:17:51,766 --> 00:17:55,596
And I was never truly alone,
thanks to my science posse:

424
00:17:55,639 --> 00:17:59,513
Stephen, Albert,
Richard and Arthur.

425
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:02,559
But for those times when I did
need to communicate with Missy,

426
00:18:02,603 --> 00:18:04,648
we had a system.

427
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:11,525
What?

428
00:18:11,568 --> 00:18:14,528
Just testing the system.
You tested it yesterday.

429
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:17,487
Just because it worked yesterday
doesn't mean it's working today.

430
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,707
It's working.
Good night.

431
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,404
Good night.
Sleep tight.

432
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,065
What?

433
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,545
Did you know when people say
"sleep tight,"

434
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:33,199
they're referring to when
beds were made of ropes,

435
00:18:33,242 --> 00:18:35,070
and the tighter the rope,
the more comfortable

436
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,246
the bed was to sleep on?
Cool.

437
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,074
Bye.

438
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,120
My sister wasn't always a fan

439
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:44,210
of my informative tidbits,
so I didn't tell her

440
00:18:44,253 --> 00:18:46,734
that the entire phrase,
"Good night, sleep tight,

441
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:49,128
don't let the bedbugs bite"
is actually

442
00:18:49,171 --> 00:18:51,739
from the 1896 book
What They Say in New England:

443
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:55,221
A Book of Signs, Sayings,
and Superstitions.

444
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:56,657
Until I told her.
